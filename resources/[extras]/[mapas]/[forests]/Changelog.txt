 Version 4.0
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

• Moved many props to GTA V Remastered and vice versa so that both mods no longer overlap. Then relocated colliding props in the area where both mods previously overlapped.
• Added over 2000 new props by merging props from GTA V Remastered v1.3 by le__AK (which adds over 8500 new props but 6500 of them remain in GTA V Remastered).
• Switched prefix from forest_* to forests_* to avoid hash collision (forest_s_d_135_lod and bh1_48_balustradb both result in hash value 0x7D7A3327). (thanks to Brainfire for reporting)
• Fixed flags of some non-vegetational entities.

 Version 3.4
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

Changes by Larcius:
• Fixed floating trees when using NaturalVision Evolved (caused by the replacement models for prop_tree_pine_01 and prop_w_r_cedar_01 since they have a higher pivot point).
• Slightly reworked LOD and SLOD models ("hat" for top view is more flat and is positioned depending on the prop).
• Reworked static collision models by splitting content into regular (no prefix) and high (prefix hi@) models.

Changes by JRod:
• Reworked a scenario file (countryside_ne.ymt).


≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡
 Version 3.3
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

• Multi-partitioned maps and major refactoring of lod and slod models (increases performance and significantly reduces required pool size of "Building").
• Adjusted brightness of some LOD and SLOD textures.
• Reduced size of static collision models by only providing static collision models of props with a scaling not close to 1.
• Rearranged packages so that it is possible to install the northern and the southern part independently (only north, only south or both).
• Edited tree that were clipping with one of the watchtowers of "Firewatch Lookout Towers" by PNWParksFan (https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/firewatch-lookout-towers). (thanks to ReNNie for reporting)


≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡
 Version 3.2
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

• Slightly reworked LOD models.
• Reworked textures for LOD and SLOD models of maple trees (Prop_Tree_Maple_02 and Prop_Tree_Maple_03).
• Changed all entities with priority level high, medium, low to level required to avoid entities not beeing displayed (see https://gtaforums.com/topic/919609-relv-v-proprestore/ for further information).
• Recalculated Z coordinates of trees so that the trunk is as high as possible but still not floating.
• Reduced/recalculated distance when to change from LOD to SLOD1 (increases performance without noticible affecting visual appearance).
• Replaced jacada trees (the pink ones) by olive trees.
• Replaced many of the dead trees by healthy ones.
• Restructured ymap files.

Changes by JRod:
• Added 27 cargens which were once part of version 2.2 and reworked some of them.
• Replaced, deleted, added some non-vegetational props and fixed clipping/floating props.

Changes by Alex106:
• Added a script to allow entering the shelter at coordinates -491.34, 2235.70, 150.87 (this requires Script Hook V .NET (https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/scripthookv-net) in order to work).

 Version 3.1
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

Visual changes:
• Replaced single standing redwood trees (TEST_Tree_Forest_Trunk_01) by other trees.
• Edited a few trees (relocated, rescaled, changed model, ...).
• Added a few trees.
• Slight rework at silo hatch.

Other changes:
• Reduced extents of static collision models and slod models.
• Reduced/recalculated values for far distance view non-tree models.
• Recalculated distance when to change from HD to LOD (slightly reduced for large entities and increased for small entities).
• Reduced/recalculated distance when to change from LOD to SLOD1.
• Fixed non-tree entities (like boxes, chairs, barrels, ...) that shouldn't be static (so now they interact physically when hit by a car, on explosions, ...).
• Provided static collision model for cabin.
• Provided OIV uninstallation file.


≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡
 Version 3.0
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

Visual changes:
• Replaced most trees by a large diversity of trees (instead of just two different tree models now there are 26 different models; see "Detailed list of trees" at bottom of page for more details).
• Changed scaling/size of trees.
• Reduced tilt of trees in accordance to their height.
• Recalculated Z coordinate of every tree.
• Created textures and models for medium far distance view (LOD models) for every kind of tree.
• In addition to medium far distance view models (LOD models) three further far distance view models were created (SLOD1 to SLOD3 models).
• Enabled reflections of trees in water (that is because for reflections mainly SLOD1 to SLOD3 models are used).
• Relocated some trees.
• Added a few trees.
• Reworked observation points "Raton Canyon" and "East Alamo View".

Other changes:
• Fixed wrong collisions by providing static collision models (before only embedded collision was used but since embedded collision ignores scaling every scaled tree ended up with a wrong collision model).
• Reduced/recalculated values for far distance view models (in accordance to their height) to be more consistent with other entities.
  (before redwood trees had a very high value which heavily affected performance and forced users to reduce "Extended Distance Scaling" under "Advanced Graphics").
• Extracted non-tree entities in separated files (.ymap).
• Performed clustering of trees to get reasonable chunks of maps (to get rid of having some ymap files with huge extents).
• Provided OIV installation file.
• Provided FiveM resource bundle. (thanks to leonad1125)
